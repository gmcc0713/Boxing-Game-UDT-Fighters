Thank you very much for your purchase.

[Virtual Sound Effects Library Vol.5 Attack]
Vol.5 is physical attack sound collection. Punch, Kick, Hook, Slap, Slash, Stab, Guard and etc.
This is not included a mechanical sound such as the machine-gun shot.
The audio files are diveided every process of the action. Swing + hit, swing + mixture of the knife + slash, shoot the bow + stab.
You can make original sound effects by putting these together.

Virtual Sound Effects series is a library narrowed down target to sound effects by synthesizer. 
All sounds are my orginal programming.
I made the resolution of the sound higher for being able to match the modern high-end games by also reforming all classical sound effects.
Always 100 original sounds are included in this package. In addition, effect processed variation sounds are included too. 
You can use variation sounds easily or edit from original sounds and make new sound effects.  
Don't be confused by a file name! It is only one of the sound images. How to use is up to you.
